# React-Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio is my official portfolio. Over time it is going to look cooler, stand out more, and overall be a pleasure to look at. Please, peruse my different projects repositories and deployed sites and let me know what you think of any that catch your eye!

## Installation

Just a computer (handheld, laptop, or desktop) to be able to view all the things I've made (thus far).

## Usage

Look through my portfolio to your hearts content. Feel free to leave me any feedback as well!
